"  Classical secular theory can be a powerful tool to describe the qualitativecharacter of multi-planet systems and offer insight into their histories. Theeigenmodes of the secular behavior, rather than current orbital elements, canhelp identify tidal effects, early planet-planet scattering, and dynamicalcoupling among the planets, for systems in which mean-motion resonances do notplay a role. Although tidal damping can result in aligned major axes after allbut one eigenmode have damped away, such alignment may simply be fortuitous. Anexample of this is 55 Cancri (orbital solution of Fischer et al., 2008) wheremultiple eigenmodes remain undamped. Various solutions for 55 Cancri arecompared, showing differing dynamical groupings, with implications for thecoupling of eccentricities and for the partitioning of damping among theplanets. Solutions for orbits that include expectations of past tidal evolutionwith observational data, must take into account which eigenmodes should bedamped, rather than expecting particular eccentricities to be near zero.Classical secular theory is only accurate for low eccentricity values, butcomparison with other results suggests that it can yield useful qualitativedescriptions of behavior even for moderately large eccentricity values, and mayhave advantages for revealing underlying physical processes and, as largenumbers of new systems are discovered, for triage to identify where morecomprehensive dynamical studies should have priority.","Sieve-SDP: a simple facial reduction algorithm to preprocess

"  We prove sharp $L^3$ bounds for a variable coefficient generalization of theWolff circular maximal function $M^\delta f$. For each fixed radius $r$,$M^\delta f(r)$ is the maximal average of $f$ over the $\delta$--neighborhoodof a circle of radius $r$ and arbitrary center. In this paper, we considermaximal averages over families of curves satisfying the cinematic curvaturecondition, which was first introduced by Sogge to generalize the Bourgaincircular maximal function. Our proof manages to avoid a key technical lemma inWolff's original argument, and thus our proof also yields a shorter proof ofthe boundedness of the (conventional) Wolff circular maximal function. At theheart of the proof is an induction argument that employs an efficientpartitioning of $\mathbb{R}^3$ into cells using the discrete polynomial hamsandwich theorem.",Transition Systems for Model Generators - A Unifying Approach,Satisfiability solvers for propositional logic,0.15384615384615385,0.3004843884984905

"  We continue the investigation of two-loop string corrections to the energy ofa folded string with a spin S in AdS_5 and an angular momentum J in S^5, in thescaling limit of large J and S with ell=pi J/(lambda^(1/2) ln S)=fixed. Wecompute the generalized scaling function at two-loop order f_2(ell) both forsmall and large values of ell matching the predictions based on the asymptoticBethe ansatz. In particular, in the small ell expansion, we derive an exactintegral form for the ell-dependent coefficient of the Catalan's constant termin f_2(ell). Also, by resumming a certain subclass of multi-loop Feynmandiagrams we obtain an exact expression for the leading (ln ell) part off(lambda^(1/2), ell) which is valid to any order in the alpha'~1/lambda^(1/2)expansion. At large ell the string energy has a BMN-like expansion and thefirst few leading coefficients are expected to be the same at weak and atstrong coupling. We provide a new example of this non-renormalization for theterm which is generated at two loops in string theory and at one-loop in gaugetheory (sub-sub-leading in 1/J). We also derive a simple algebraic formula forthe term of maximal transcendentality in f_2(ell) expanded at large ell. In thesecond part of the paper we initiate the study of 2-loop finite sizecorrections to the string energy by formally compactifying the spatialworld-sheet direction in the string action expanded near long fast-spinningstring. We observe that the leading finite-size corrections are of ""Casimir""type coming from terms containing at least one massless propagator. We considerin detail the one-loop order (reproducing the leading Landau-Lifshitz modelprediction) and then focus on the two-loop contributions to the (1/ln S) term(for J=0). We find that in a certain regularization scheme used to discardpower divergences the two-loop coefficient of the (1/ln S) term appears tovanish.",Privacy Policy Negotiation in Social Media,"A Heuristic for a Better Privacy-Aware Social Media

"  Temporal coding is one approach to representing information in spiking neuralnetworks. An example of its application is the location of sounds by barn owlsthat requires especially precise temporal coding. Dependent upon the azimuthalangle, the arrival times of sound signals are shifted between both ears. Inorder to deter- mine these interaural time differences, the phase difference ofthe signals is measured. We implemented this biologically inspired network on aneuromorphic hardware system and demonstrate spike-timing dependent plasticityon an analog, highly accelerated hardware substrate. Our neuromorphicimplementation enables the resolution of time differences of less than 50 ns.On-chip Hebbian learning mechanisms select inputs from a pool of neurons whichcode for the same sound frequency. Hence, noise caused by different synapticdelays across these inputs is reduced.

"  The memory model for RISC-V, a newly developed open source ISA, has not beenfinalized yet and thus, offers an opportunity to evaluate existing memorymodels. We believe RISC-V should not adopt the memory models of POWER or ARM,because their axiomatic and operational definitions are too complicated. Wepropose two new weak memory models: WMM and WMM-S, which balance definitionalsimplicity and implementation flexibility differently. Both allow allinstruction reorderings except overtaking of loads by a store. We show thatthis restriction has little impact on performance and it considerablysimplifies operational definitions. It also rules out the out-of-thin-airproblem that plagues many definitions. WMM is simple (it is similar to theAlpha memory model), but it disallows behaviors arising due to shared storebuffers and shared write-through caches (which are seen in POWER processors).WMM-S, on the other hand, is more complex and allows these behaviors. We givethe operational definitions of both models using Instantaneous InstructionExecution (I2E), which has been used in the definitions of SC and TSO.

"  We study the wave functions of light and heavy mesons in both hard-wall (HW)and soft-wall (SW) holographic models which use AdS/CFT correspondence. In thecase of massless constituents, the asymptotic behaviors of the electromagneticform factor, the distribution amplitudes, and the decay constants for the twomodels are the same, if the relation between the dilaton scale parameter andthe size of meson is an inverse proportion. On the other hand, by introducing aquark mass dependence in the wave function, the differences of the distributionamplitudes between the two models are obvious. In addition, for the SW model,the dependences of the decay constants of meson on the dilaton scale parameter$\kappa$ differ; especially f_{Qq}\sim \kappa^3/m_Q^2 is consistent with theprediction of the heavy quark effective theory if \kappa\sim m_Q^{1/2}.

"  POLARBEAR-2 is a next-generation receiver for precision measurements of thepolarization of the cosmic microwave background (Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB)). Scheduled to deploy in early 2015, it will observe alongside theexisting POLARBEAR-1 receiver, on a new telescope in the Simons Array on CerroToco in the Atacama desert of Chile. For increased sensitivity, it will featurea larger area focal plane, with a total of 7,588 polarization sensitiveantenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers, with a designsensitivity of 4.1 uKrt(s). The focal plane will be cooled to 250 milliKelvin,and the bolometers will be read-out with 40x frequency domain multiplexing,with 36 optical bolometers on a single SQUID amplifier, along with 2 darkbolometers and 2 calibration resistors. To increase the multiplexing factorfrom 8x for POLARBEAR-1 to 40x for POLARBEAR-2 requires additional bandwidthfor SQUID readout and well-defined frequency channel spacing. Extending tothese higher frequencies requires new components and design for the LC filterswhich define channel spacing. The LC filters are cold resonant circuits with aninductor and capacitor in series with each bolometer, and stray inductance inthe wiring and equivalent series resistance from the capacitors can affectbolometer operation. We present results from characterizing these new readoutcomponents.

"  The non-Fourier heat conduction phenomenon on room temperature is analyzedfrom various aspects. The first one shows its experimental side, in what formit occurs and how we treated it. It is demonstrated that the Guyer-Krumhanslequation can be the next appropriate extension of Fourier's law for roomtemperature phenomena in modeling of heterogeneous materials. The secondapproach provides an interpretation of generalized heat conduction equationsusing a simple thermomechanical background. Here, Fourier heat conduction iscoupled to elasticity via thermal expansion, resulting in a particulargeneralized heat equation for the temperature field. Both of the aforementionedapproaches show the size dependency of non-Fourier heat conduction. Finally, athird approach is presented, called pseudo-temperature modeling. It is shownthat non-Fourier temperature history can be produced by mixing differentsolutions of Fourier's law. That kind of explanation indicates theinterpretation of underlying heat conduction mechanics behind non-Fourierphenomena.","A sparse control approach to optimal sensor placement in PDE-constrained

"  Scale selection methods based on local extrema over scale of scale-normalizedderivatives have been primarily developed to be applied sparsely --- at imagepoints where the magnitude of a scale-normalized differential expressionadditionally assumes local extrema over the domain where the data are defined.This paper presents a methodology for performing dense scale selection, so thathypotheses about local characteristic scales in images, temporal signals andvideo can be computed at every image point and every time moment.  A critical problem when designing mechanisms for dense scale selection isthat the scale at which scale-normalized differential entities assume localextrema over scale can be strongly dependent on the local order of the locallydominant differential structure. To address this problem, we propose amethodology where local extrema over scale are detected of a quasi quadraturemeasure involving scale-space derivatives up to order two and propose twoindependent mechanisms to reduce the phase dependency of the local scaleestimates by: (i) introducing a second layer of post-smoothing prior to thedetection of local extrema over scale and (ii) performing local phasecompensation based on a model of the phase dependency of the local scaleestimates depending on the relative strengths between first- vs. second-orderdifferential structure.  This general methodology is applied over three types of domains: (i) spatialimages, (ii) temporal signals and (iii) spatio-temporal video. Experiments showthat the proposed methodology leads to intuitively reasonable results withlocal scale estimates that reflect variations in the characteristic scales oflocally dominant structures over space and time.","A simple and efficient numerical method for computing the dynamics of

"  We present a contemporary perspective on the String Landscape and theMultiverse of plausible string, M- and F-theory vacua, seeking to demonstrate anon-zero probability for the existence of a universe matching our own observedphysics within the solution ensemble, arguing for the importance of No-ScaleSupergravity as an essential common underpinning. Our context is a highlydetailed phenomenological probe of No-Scale F-SU(5), a model representing theintersection of the F-lipped SU(5) X U(1)_X Grand Unified Theory (GUT) withextra TeV-Scale vector-like multiplets derived out of F-theory, and thedynamics of No-Scale Supergravity.

Although the H I clouds are not easily separated in velocity withsome mixed component represented by merged line profiles, the atomic gas massamounts to 6 x 10^6 M_Sol and 9 x 10^6 M_Sol for each component. Thesecharacteristics of H I gas and the distributions of dense molecular gas in theoverlapping regions of the two velocity components suggest that the formationof giant molecular clouds and the following massive cluster formation have beeninduced by the collision of H I clouds with different velocities. Referring tothe existence of gas bridging feature connecting M33 with M31 reported bylarge-scale HI surveys, the disturbed atomic gas possibly represent the resultof past tidal interaction between the two galaxies, which is analogous to theformation of the R136 cluster in the LMC.",TWIST: Precision Measurement of the Muon Decay Parameters,Measurement of three decay parameters in muon decay,0.5,0.43472087194499137
"  The fusion probability in ""hot"" fusion reactions leading to the synthesis ofsuper-heavy nuclei is investigated systematically. The quasi-fission barrierinfluences the formation of the super-heavy nucleus around the ""island ofstability"" in addition to the shell correction. Based on the quasi-fissionbarrier height obtained with the Skyrme energy-density functional, we proposean analytical expression for the description of the fusion probability, withwhich the measured evaporation residual cross sections can be reproducedacceptably well. Simultaneously, some special fusion reactions for synthesizingnew elements 119 and 120 are studied. The predicted evaporation residual crosssections for 50Ti+249Bk are about 10-150fb at energies around theentrance-channel Coulomb barrier. For the fusion reactions synthesizing element120 with projectiles 54Cr and 58Fe, the cross sections fall to a few femtobarnswhich seems beyond the limit of the available facilities.","Supersymmetric U(1)B x U(1)L model with leptophilic and leptophobic cold

"  We investigate coarse equilibrium states of a fine-scale, stochasticagent-based model of consumer lock-in in a duopolistic market.

Wethen study the emergence of coarse fronts when spatial segregation is presentin the relative perceived quality of products. We develop a novel Newton-Krylovmethod that is able to compute accurately and efficiently coarse fixed pointswhen the underlying fine-scale dynamics is stochastic. The main novelty of thealgorithm is in the elimination of the noise that is generated when estimatingJacobian-vector products using time-integration of perturbed initialconditions.

"  EM emissions in a wide frequency spectrum ranging from kHz to MHz areproduced by opening cracks, which can be considered as precursors of generalfracture. An important feature, observed on both laboratory and geophysicalscale, is that the MHz radiation systematically precedes the kHz one. Yet, thelink between an individual EM precursor and a distinctive stage of the EQpreparation comprises a crucial open question. A recently proposed two-stagemodel on preseismic EM activity suggests that the MHz EM emission is due to thefracture of the highly heterogeneous system that surrounds the fault. Thefinally emerged kHz EM emission is rooted in the final stage of EQ generation,namely, the fracture of entities sustaining the system. In this work we try tofurther penetrate and elucidate the link of the precursory kHz EM activity withthe last stage of EQ generation building on two theoretical models for EQdynamics. Firstly, the self-affine model states that an EQ is due to theslipping of two rough and rigid fractional Brownian profiles, one over theother, when there is an intersection between them. Secondly, thefragment-asperity model, rooted in a nonextensive Tsallis framework startingfrom first principles, consists of two rough profiles interacting via fragmentsfilling the gap. In the latter approach, the mechanism of triggering EQ isestablished through the interaction of the irregularities of the fault planesand the fragments between them. This paper shows that these models of EQdynamics can be linked with the detected kHz EM emission. In this framework ofanalysis of preseismic EM activity, we identify sufficient criteria that offerthe possibility to discriminate whether a seismic shock is sourced in thefracture of fragments filling the gap between the rough profiles or in thefracture of ""teeth"" distributed across the fractional Brownian profiles thatsustain the system.","Scalar particles emission from black holes with topological defects

"  Many natural language processing (NLP) applications require the computationof similarities between pairs of syntactic or semantic trees. Many researchershave used tree edit distance for this task, but this technique suffers from thedrawback that it deals with single node operations only. We have extended thestandard tree edit distance algorithm to deal with subtree transformationoperations as well as single nodes. The extended algorithm with subtreeoperations, TED+ST, is more effective and flexible than the standard algorithm,especially for applications that pay attention to relations among nodes (e.g.in linguistic trees, deleting a modifier subtree should be cheaper than the sumof deleting its components individually). We describe the use of TED+ST forchecking entailment between two Arabic text snippets. The preliminary resultsof using TED+ST were encouraging when compared with two string-based approachesand with the standard algorithm.","Moment transport equations and their application to the perturbed

"  Verification of large and complicated concurrent programs is an importantissue in the software world. Stateless model checking is an appropriate methodfor systematically and automatically testing of large programs, which hasproved its power in verifying code of large programs. Another well-known methodin this area is runtime verification. Both stateless model checking and runtimeverification are similar in some ways. One common approach in runtimeverification is to construct runtime monitors for properties expressed inlinear temporal logic. Currently, there are some semantics to check lineartemporal logic formulae on finite paths proposed in the field of runtimeverification, which can also be applied to stateless model checking. However,existing stateless model checkers do not support LTL formulae. In somesettings, it is more advantageous to make use of stateless model checkinginstead of runtime verification. This paper proposes a novel encoding of one ofthe recent LTL semantics on finite paths into an actor-based system. We take atruly parallel approach without saving any program states or traces, which notonly addresses important problems in runtime verification, but can also beapplied to stateless model checking.","Stability properties of a two-dimensional system involving one Caputo

"  Birth asphyxia is a major newborn mortality problem in low-resourcecountries. International guideline provides treatment recommendations; however,the importance and effect of the different treatments are not fully explored.The available data is collected in Tanzania, during newborn resuscitation, foranalysis of the resuscitation activities and the response of the newborn. Animportant step in the analysis is to create activity timelines of the episodes,where activities include ventilation, suction, stimulation etc. Methods: Theavailable recordings are noisy real-world videos with large variations. Wepropose a two-step process in order to detect activities possibly overlappingin time. The first step is to detect and track the relevant objects, likebag-mask resuscitator, heart rate sensors etc., and the second step is to usethis information to recognize the resuscitation activities. The topic of thispaper is the first step, and the object detection and tracking are based onconvolutional neural networks followed by post processing. Results: Theperformance of the object detection during activities were 96.97 %(ventilations), 100 % (attaching/removing heart rate sensor) and 75 % (suction)on a test set of 20 videos. The system also estimate the number of health careproviders present with a performance of 71.16 %. Conclusion: The proposedobject detection and tracking system provides promising results in noisynewborn resuscitation videos.

"  Enabling the Internet of things in remote environments without traditionalcommunication infrastructure requires a multi-layer network architecture.Devices in the overlay network such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) arerequired to provide coverage to underlay devices as well as remain connected toother overlay devices to exploit device-to-device (D2D) communication. Thecoordination, planning, and design of such overlay networks constrained by theunderlay devices is a challenging problem. Existing frameworks for placement ofUAVs do not consider the lack of backhaul connectivity and the need for D2Dcommunication. Furthermore, they ignore the dynamical aspects of connectivityin such networks which presents additional challenges. For instance, theconnectivity of devices can be affected by changes in the network, e.g., themobility of underlay devices or unavailability of overlay devices due tofailure or adversarial attacks. To this end, this work proposes a feedbackbased adaptive, self-configurable, and resilient framework for the overlaynetwork that cognitively adapts to the changes in the network to providereliable connectivity between spatially dispersed smart devices. Results showthat the proposed framework requires significantly lower number of aerial basestations to provide higher coverage and connectivity to remotely deployedmobile devices as compared to existing approaches.",Gauge Orbit Types for Theories with Classical Compact Gauge Group,"On the orbit types of local gaugetransformations over connected

"  We propose a simple, efficient and accurate numerical method for simulatingthe dynamics of rotating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a rotational framewith/without a long-range dipole-dipole interaction. We begin with thethree-dimensional (3D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with an angular momentumrotation term and/or long-range dipole-dipole interaction, state thetwo-dimensional (2D) GPE obtained from the 3D GPE via dimension reduction underanisotropic external potential and review some dynamical laws related to the 2Dand 3D GPE. By introducing a rotating Lagrangian coordinate system, theoriginal GPEs are re-formulated to GPEs without the angular momentum rotationwhich is replaced by a time-dependent potential in the new coordinate system.We then cast the conserved quantities and dynamical laws in the new rotatingLagrangian coordinates. Based on the new formulation of the GPE for rotatingBECs in the rotating Lagrangian coordinates, a time-splitting spectral methodis presented for computing the dynamics of rotating BECs. The new numericalmethod is explicit, simple to implement, unconditionally stable and veryefficient in computation. It is spectral order accurate in space andsecond-order accurate in time, and conserves the mass in the discrete level.Extensive numerical results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency andaccuracy of the new numerical method. Finally, the numerical method is appliedto test the dynamical laws of rotating BECs such as the dynamics of condensatewidth, angular momentum expectation and center-of-mass, and to investigatenumerically the dynamics and interaction of quantized vortex lattices inrotating BECs without/with the long-range dipole-dipole interaction.",Collapse and dispersal in massless scalar field models,Collapse and dispersal for massless scalar fields,0.7999999999999999,0.44815260192961937
"  We introduce a cumulant expansion to parameterize possible initial conditionsin relativistic heavy ion collisions. We show that the cumulant expansionconverges and that it can systematically reproduce the results of Glauber typeinitial conditions. At third order in the gradient expansion, the cumulantscharacterize the triangularity $<r^3 \cos3(\phi - \psi_{3,3})>$ and the dipoleasymmetry $<r^3 \cos(\phi- \psi_{1,3})>$ of the initial entropy distribution.We show that for mid-peripheral collisions the orientation angle of the dipoleasymmetry $\psi_{1,3}$ has a $20%$ preference out of plane. This leads to asmall net $v_1$ out of plane. In peripheral and mid-central collisions theorientation angles $\psi_{1,3}$ and $\psi_{3,3}$ are strongly correlated. Westudy the ideal hydrodynamic response to these cumulants and determine theassociated $v_1/\epsilon_1$ and $v_3/\epsilon_3$ for a massless ideal gasequation of state. $v_1$ and $v_3$ develop towards the edge of the nucleus, andconsequently the final spectra are more sensitive to the viscous dynamics offreezeout. The hydrodynamic calculations for $v_3$ are compared to Alver andRoland fit of two particle correlation functions. Finally, we propose tomeasure the $v_1$ associated with the dipole asymmetry and the correlationsbetween $\psi_{1,3}$ and $\psi_{3,3}$ by measuring a two particle correlationwith respect to the participant plane, $<\cos(\phi_a - 3\phi_b + 2\Psi_{PP})>$.The hydrodynamic prediction for this correlation function is several timeslarger than a correlation currently measured by the STAR collaboration,$<\cos(\phi_a + \phi_\b - 2\Psi_{PP})>$.",E6SSM vs MSSM gluino phenomenology,The E6SSM: A new model for gluino cascaded chains,0.2857142857142857,0.5773502691896257
"  News reports shape the public perception of the critical social, politicaland economical events around the world. Yet, the way in which emergentphenomena are reported in the news makes the early prediction of such phenomenaa challenging task. We propose a scalable community-based probabilisticframework to model the spreading of news about events in online media. Ourapproach exploits the latent community structure in the global news media anduses the affiliation of the early adopters with a variety of communities toidentify the events widely reported in the news at the early stage of theirspread. The time complexity of our approach is linear in the number of newsreports. It is also amenable to efficient parallelization. To demonstrate thesefeatures, the inference algorithm is parallelized for message passing paradigmand tested on RPI Advanced Multiprocessing Optimized System (AMOS), one of thefastest Blue Gene/Q supercomputers in the world. Thanks to the community-levelfeatures of the early adopters, the model gains an improvement of 20% in theearly detection of the most massively reported events compared to thefeature-based machine learning algorithm. Its parallelization scheme achievesorders of magnitude speedup.","Heterogeneous Networked Data Recovery from Compressive Measurements

"  D3-branes are often a necessary ingredient in global compactifications ofF-theory. In minimal realizations of flavor hierarchies in F-theory GUT models,suitable fluxes are turned on, which in turn attract D3-branes to the Yukawapoints. Of particular importance are ``E-type'' Yukawa points, as they arerequired to realize a large top quark mass. In this paper we study theworldvolume theory of a D3-brane probing such an E-point. D3-brane probes ofisolated exceptional singularities lead to strongly coupled N = 2 CFTs of thetype found by Minahan and Nemeschansky. We show that the local data of anE-point probe theory determines an N = 1 deformation of the original N = 2theory which couples this strongly interacting CFT to a free hypermultiplet.Monodromy in the seven-brane configuration translates to a novel class ofdeformations of the CFT. We study how the probe theory couples to the StandardModel, determining the most relevant F-term couplings, the effect of the probeon the running of the Standard Model gauge couplings, as well as possiblesources of kinetic mixing with the Standard Model.","Generalized (kappa,mu)-Paracontact Metric Manifolds with xi(mu)=0","Local classification of generalized (kappa,mu)-Paracontact Metric Manifolds",0.631578947368421,0.4111336169005197

Thecognitive map has been developed, based on the architectural blueprint maps.The idea for using the medial-axis is to find main path central pixels; eachcenter pixel represents the center distance between two side boarder pixels.The need for these pixels in the algorithm comes from the need of building anetwork of nodes for the path, where each node represents a turning in the realworld (left, right, critical left, critical right...). The algorithm alsoignores from finding the center pixels paths that are too small for intelligentrobot navigation. The Idea of this algorithm is to find the possible shortestpath between start and end points. The goal of this research is to extract asimple, robust representation of the shape of the cognitive map together withthe optimal shortest path between start and end points.

"  Existing semantically secure public-key searchable encryption schemes takesearch time linear with the total number of the ciphertexts. This makesretrieval from large-scale databases prohibitive. To alleviate this problem,this paper proposes Searchable Public-Key Ciphertexts with Hidden Structures(SPCHS) for keyword search as fast as possible without sacrificing semanticsecurity of the encrypted keywords. In SPCHS, all keyword-searchableciphertexts are structured by hidden relations, and with the search trapdoorcorresponding to a keyword, the minimum information of therelations isdisclosed to a search algorithm as the guidance to find all matchingciphertexts efficiently. We construct a simple SPCHS scheme from scratch inwhich the ciphertexts have a hidden star-like structure. We prove our scheme tobe semantically secure based on the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellmanassumption in the Random Oracle (RO) model. The search complexity of our schemeis dependent on the actual number of the ciphertexts containing the queriedkeyword, rather than the number of all ciphertexts. Finally, we present ageneric SPCHS construction from anonymous identity-based encryption andcollision-free full-identity malleable Identity-Based Key EncapsulationMechanism (IBKEM) with anonymity. We illustrate two collision-freefull-identity malleable IBKEM instances, which are semantically secure andanonymous, respectively, in the RO and standard models.

"  In Ultrasound (US) imaging, Delay and Sum (DAS) is the most commonbeamformer, but it leads to low quality images. Delay Multiply and Sum (DMAS)was introduced to address this problem. However, the reconstructed images usingDMAS still suffer from level of sidelobes and low noise suppression. In thispaper, a novel beamforming algorithm is introduced based on the expansion ofDMAS formula. It is shown that there is a DAS algebra inside the expansion, andit is proposed to use DMAS instead of the DAS algebra. The introduced method,namely Double Stage DMAS (DS-DMAS), is evaluated numerically andexperimentally. The quantitative results indicate that DS-DMAS results in about25% lower level of sidelobes compared to DMAS. Moreover, the introduced methodleads to 23%, 22% and 43% improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio,Full-Width-Half-Maximum and Contrast Ratio, respectively, in comparison withDMAS beamformer.",Accessible Interactive Maps for Visually Impaired Users,Interactive Tactile Maps for Visually Impaired Users,0.8571428571428571,0.6434588841607617

"  The review-based recommender systems are commonly utilized to measure userspreferences towards different items. In this paper, we focus on addressingthree main problems existing in the review-based methods. Firstly, thesemethods suffer from the class-imbalanced problem where rating levels with lowerproportions will be ignored to some extent. Thus, their performance onrelatively rare rating levels is unsatisfactory. As the first attempt in thisfield to address this problem, we propose a flexible dual-optimizer model togain robustness from both regression loss and classification loss. Secondly, toaddress the problem caused by the insufficient contextual informationextraction ability of word embedding, we first introduce BERT into thereview-based method to improve the performance of the semantic analysis.Thirdly, the existing methods ignore the feature information of thetime-varying user preferences. Therefore, we propose a time-varying featureextraction module with bidirectional long short-term memory and multi-scaleconvolutional neural network. Afterward, an interaction component is proposedto further summarize the contextual information of the user-item pairs. Toverify the effectiveness of the proposed TADO, we conduct extensive experimentson 23 benchmark datasets selected from Amazon Product Reviews. Compared withseveral recently proposed state-of-the-art methods, our model obtainssignificant gain over ALFM, MPCN, and ANR averagely with 20.98\%, 9.84\%, and15.46\%, respectively.

However, in agreedy best-first search, the ordering of states induced by a heuristic is moreindicative of the resulting planner's performance than mean squared error.Thus, we instead frame learning a heuristic as a learning to rank problem whichwe solve using a RankSVM formulation. Additionally, we introduce new methodsfor computing features that capture temporal interactions in an approximateplan.

"  The effects of dislocation climb on plastic deformation during loading andunloading are studied using a two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamicsmodel. Simulations are performed for polycrystalline thin films passivated onboth surfaces. Dislocation climb lowers the overall level of the stress insidethin films and reduces the work hardening rate. Climb decreases the density ofdislocations in pile-ups and reduces back stresses. These factors result in asmaller Bauschinger effect on unloading compared to simulations without climb.As dislocations continue to climb at the onset of unloading and the dislocationdensity continues to increase, the initial unloading slope increases withdecreasing unloading rate. Because climb disperses dislocations, fewerdislocations are annihilated during unloading, leading to a higher dislocationdensity at the end of the unloading step.","Simplified modeling of cluster-shell competition in $^{20}$Ne and

In order to be effective, a heuristic must be efficient to compute, as wellas provide useful information to the search algorithm. However, some well-knownheuristics which do well in reducing backtracking are so heavy that the gain ofdeploying them in a search algorithm might be outweighed by their overhead.  We propose a rational metareasoning approach to decide when to deployheuristics, using CSP backtracking search as a case study. In particular, avalue of information approach is taken to adaptive deployment of solution-countestimation heuristics for value ordering.

"  It is now widely accepted that the universe as we understand it isaccelerating in expansion and fits the de Sitter model rather well. As such, arealistic assumption of black holes must place them on a de Sitter backgroundand not Minkowski as is typically done in General Relativity. The mostastrophysically relevant black hole is the uncharged, rotating Kerr solution, amember of the more general Kerr-Newman metrics. A generalization of therotating Kerr black hole to a solution of the Einstein's equation with acosmological constant $\Lambda$ was discovered by Carter \cite{DWDW}. It istypically referred to as the Kerr-de Sitter spacetime. Here, we discuss thehorizon structure of this spacetime and its dependence on $\Lambda$. We recallthat in a $\La>0$ universe, the term `extremal black hole' refers to a blackhole with angular momentum $J > M^2 $. We obtain explicit numerical results forthe black hole's maximal spin value and get a distribution of admissible Kerrholes in the ($\Lambda$, spin) parameter space. We look at the conformalstructure of the extended spacetime and the embedding of the 3-geometry of thespatial hypersurfaces. In analogy with Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m -de Sitterspacetime, in particular by considering the Kerr-de Sitter causal structure asa distortion of the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-de Sitter one, we show that spatialsections of the extended spacetime are 3-spheres containing 2-dimensionaltopologically spherical sections of the horizons of Kerr holes at the poles.Depending on how a $t=$ constant 3-space is defined these holes may be seen asblack or white holes (four possible combinations).","On symmetries and conservation laws of a Gardner equation involving

"  During plastic deformation of granular materials due to loading, thestress-strain and strength characteristics of sand grains are influenced withgrain size, their distribution and packing. Also the macroscopic behaviour ofgranular materials changes with the variation of microscopic behaviour.Particle size is one of the important properties which plays a dominant role onthe stress, strain and strength responses of granular materials. Alteration ofgrain size results in the change of void ratio as well as particle effectivecontact area revolutionized and the load distribution mechanism of particle toparticle contact. To evaluate the effect of particle size, a series of directshear tests were performed considering uniform particles of eight samples(0.075, 0.15, 0.212, 0.300, 0.600, 1.18, 1.72 and 2.76 mm) and graded particlesof two samples (0.075-1.18 mm and 0.075-2.36 mm). Three types of normal loads(0.05, 0.10 and 0.15 kN) were selected for each test. For uniform particles,particles retained on individual sieve size were considered and in gradedparticles combination of each uniform particle pondered. A theoretical approachwas also proposed to correlate the particle size and macroscopic response. Fromthe experimental results, it was observed that for each set of normal load withthe increase of particle size ,angle of internal friction as well as maximumhorizontal shear stress increases for uniform sands and a similar response wasnoticed in graded sands but the larger the gradation the higher the shearstrength. Maximum horizontal shear and angle of internal friction with respectto particle size is also influenced by normal stress.

"  We propose a novel deep learning based denoising filter selection algorithmfor noisy Electrocardiograph (ECG) signal preprocessing. ECG signals measuredunder clinical conditions, such as those acquired using skin contact devices inhospitals, often contain baseline signal disturbances and unwanted artefacts;indeed for signals obtained outside of a clinical environment, such as heartrate signatures recorded using non-contact radar systems, the measurementscontain greater levels of noise than those acquired under clinical conditions.In this paper, we focus on heart rate signals acquired using non-contact radarsystems for use in assisted living environments. Such signals contain morenoise than those measured under clinical conditions and thus require a novelsignal noise removal method capable of adaptive determining filters. Currently,the most common method of removing noise from such a waveform is through theuse of filters; the most popular filtering method amongst which is the waveletfilter. There are, however, circumstances in which using a different filteringmethod may result in higher signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR) for a waveform; inthis paper, we investigate the wavelet and elliptical filtering methods for thetask of reducing noise in ECG signals acquired using assistive technologies.Our proposed convolutional neural network architecture classifies (with 92.8%accuracy) the optimum filtering method for noisy signal based on its expectedSNR value.",Influences Combination of Multi-Sensor Images on Classification Accuracy,"Supervised Machine Learning Classification of Remote Sensing Images using

"  Supersymmetric GUTs are the most natural extension of the Standard modelunifying electroweak and strong forces. Despite their indubitable virtues,among these the gauge coupling unification and the quantization of the electriccharge, one of their shortcomings is the large number of parameters used todescribe the high energy thresholds (HET), which are hard to handle. We presenta new method according to which the effects of the HET, in any GUT model, canbe described by fewer parameters that are randomly produced from the originalset of the parameters of the model. In this way, regions favoured by theexperimental data are easier to locate, avoiding a detailed and time consumingexploration of the parameter space, which is multidimensional even in the mosteconomic unifying schemes. To check the efficiency of this method, we directlyapply it to a SUSY SO(10) GUT model in which the doublet-triplet splitting isrealized through the Dimopoulos-Wilczek mechanism. We show that the demand ofgauge coupling unification, in conjunction with precision data, locates regionsof the parameter space in which values of the strong coupling \astrong arewithin the experimental limits, along with a suppressed nucleon decay, mediatedby a higgsino driven dimension five operators, yielding lifetimes that arecomfortably above the current experimental bounds.

We focus on parameter regions around the highlysymmetric $SU(3)$ point where the bilinear and biquadratic interactions areequal. With growing further-neighbor biquadratic interactions, we identifydifferent spin dipolar and quadrupolar orders. We find that the DMRG results oncylindrical geometries correctly detect nematicity in different quantum statesand accurately characterize the quantum phase transitions among them.Therefore, spin-driven nematicity -- here defined as the spontaneous breakingof the lattice invariance under a 90$^o$ rotation -- is an order parameterwhich can be studied directly in DMRG calculations in two dimensions indifferent quantum states.",Another application of Linnik's dispersion method,A general dispersion estimate for type-II sums,0.13333333333333333,0.6147881529512643

"  In order to ensure efficient flow of goods in an automated warehouse and toguarantee its continuous distribution to/from picking stations in an effectiveway, decisions about which goods will be delivered to which particular pickingstation by which robot and by which path and in which time have to be madebased on the current state of the warehouse. This task involves solution of twosuproblems: (1) task allocation in which an assignment of robots to goods theyhave to deliver at a particular time is found and (2) planning ofcollision-free trajectories for particular robots (given their actual and goalpositions). The trajectory planning problem is addressed in this paper takinginto account specifics of automated warehouses. First, assignments of allrobots are not known in advance, they are instead presented to the algorithmgradually one by one. Moreover, we do not optimize a makespan, but a throughput- the sum of individual robot plan costs. We introduce a novel approach to thisproblem which is based on the context-aware route planning algorithm [1]. Theperformed experimental results show that the proposed approach has a lower failrate and produces results of higher quality than the original algorithm.

"  In this paper we address the stability of resonantly forced density waves indense planetary rings.  Already by Goldreich & Tremaine (1978) it has been argued that density wavesmight be unstable, depending on the relationship between the ring's viscosityand the surface mass density.  In the recent paper Schmidt et al. (2016) we have pointed out that when -within a fluid description of the ring dynamics - the criterion for viscousoverstability is satisfied, forced spiral density waves become unstable aswell.  In this case, linear theory fails to describe the damping, but nonlinearityof the underlying equations guarantees a finite amplitude and eventually adamping of the wave.  We apply the multiple scale formalism to derive a weakly nonlinear dampingrelation from a hydrodynamical model.  This relation describes the resonant excitation and nonlinear viscous dampingof spiral density waves in a vertically integrated fluid disk with densitydependent transport coefficients.  The model consistently predicts density waves to be (linearly) unstable in aring region where the conditions for viscous overstability are met.  Sufficiently far away from the Lindblad resonance, the surface mass densityperturbation is predicted to saturate to a constant value due to nonlinearviscous damping.  The wave's damping lengths of the model depend on certain input parameters,such as the distance to the threshold for viscous overstability in parameterspace and the ground state surface mass density.","Crossing barriers in planetesimal formation: The growth of mm-dust

"  The inner part of protoplanetary disks can be threaded by strong magneticfields. In laboratory levitation experiments, we study how magnetic fields upto 7 mT influence the aggregation of dust by observing the self-consistentcollisional evolution of particle ensembles. As dust samples we use mixtures ofiron and quartz in different ratios. Without magnetic fields, particles in allsamples grow into a bouncing barrier. These aggregates reversibly form largerclusters in the presence of magnetic fields. The size of these clusters dependson the strength of the magnetic field and the ratio between iron and quartz.The clustering increases the size of the largest entities by a factor of a few.If planetesimal formation is sensitive to the size of the largest aggregates,e.g., relying on streaming instabilities, then planetesimals willpreferentially grow iron-rich in the inner region of protoplanetary disks. Thismight explain the iron gradient in the solar system and the formation of denseMercury-like planets.","Random minibatch subgradient algorithms for convex problems with

"  The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) challenges the end-to-end transport ofthe Internet by low power lossy links and gateways that perform protocoltranslations. Protocols such as CoAP or MQTT-SN are degraded by the overhead ofDTLS sessions, which in common deployment protect content transfer only up tothe gateway. To preserve content security end-to-end via gateways and proxies,the IETF recently developed Object Security for Constrained RESTfulEnvironments (OSCORE), which extends CoAP with content object security featurescommonly known from Information Centric Networks (ICN).  This paper presents a comparative analysis of protocol stacks that protectrequest-response transactions. We measure protocol performances of CoAP overDTLS, OSCORE, and the information-centric Named Data Networking (NDN) protocolon a large-scale IoT testbed in single- and multi-hop scenarios. Our findingsindicate that (a) OSCORE improves on CoAP over DTLS in error-prone wirelessregimes due to omitting the overhead of maintaining security sessions atendpoints, and (b) NDN attains superior robustness and reliability due to itsintrinsic network caches and hop-wise retransmissions.","On the selection of the correct number of terms for profile

"  Social Media involve many shared items, such as photos, which may concernmore than one user. The first challenge we address in this paper is to developa way for users of such items to take a decision on to whom to share theseitems. This is not an easy problem, as users' privacy preferences for the sameitem may conflict, so an approach that just merges in some way the users'privacy preferences may provide unsatisfactory results. We propose anegotiation mechanism for users to agree on a compromise for the conflictsfound. The second challenge we address in this paper relates to the exponentialcomplexity of such a negotiation mechanism, which could make it too slow to beused in practice in a Social Media infrastructure. To address this, we proposeheuristics that reduce the complexity of the negotiation mechanism and show howsubstantial benefits can be derived from the use of these heuristics throughextensive experimental evaluation that compares the performance of thenegotiation mechanism with and without these heuristics. Moreover, we show thatone such heuristic makes the negotiation mechanism produce results fast enoughto be used in actual Social Media infrastructures with near-optimal results.",MoB2:a new multifunctional transition metal diboride monolayer,"Mechanical, Thermal, and Transport Properties of Transition Metal

"  In his Foundations of a General Theory of Manifolds, Georg Cantor praisedBernard Bolzano as a clear defender of actual infinity who had the courage towork with infinite numbers. At the same time, he sharply criticized the wayBolzano dealt with them. Cantor's concept was based on the existence of aone-to-one correspondence, while Bolzano insisted on Euclid's Axiom of thewhole being greater than a part. Cantor's set theory has eventually prevailed,and became a formal basis of contemporary mathematics, while Bolzano's approachis generally considered a step in the wrong direction.  In the present paper, we demonstrate that a fragment of Bolzano's theory ofinfinite quantities retaining the part-whole principle can be extended to aconsistent mathematical structure. It can be interpreted in several possibleways. We obtain either a linearly ordered ring of finite and infinitely greatquantities, or a a partially ordered ring containing infinitely small, finiteand infinitely great quantities. These structures can be used as a basis of theinfinitesimal calculus similarly as in Non-standard Analysis, whether in itsfull version employing ultrafilters due to Abraham Robinson, or in the recent""cheap version"" avoiding ultrafilters due to Terrence Tao.","The perovskite/transport layer interfaces dominate non-radiative

"  Like the magnetised planets in our Solar System, magnetised exoplanets shouldemit strongly at radio wavelengths. Radio emission directly traces theplanetary magnetic fields and radio detections can place constraints on thephysical parameters of these features. Large comparative studies of predictedradio emission characteristics for the known population of exoplanets help toidentify what physical parameters could be key for producing bright, observableradio emission. Since the last comparative study, many thousands of exoplanetshave been discovered. We report new estimates for the radio flux densities andmaximum emission frequencies for the current population of known exoplanetsorbiting pre-main sequence and main-sequence stars with spectral types F-M. Theset of exoplanets predicted to produce observable radio emission are HotJupiters orbiting young stars.

Here, we show how these two processes are intimately linked throughthe negative reflection phenomenon. A negative reflecting mirror converts awave of positive phase velocity into its negative counterpart and vice versa.In this article, we experimentally demonstrate this phenomenon with elasticwaves in a 2D billiard and in a disordered plate by means of laserinterferometry. Despite the complexity of such configurations, the negativelyreflected wave field focuses back towards the initial source location, therebymimicking a phase conjugation operation while being a fully passive process.The super-focusing capability of negative reflection is also highlighted in amonochromatic regime. The negative reflection phenomenon is not restricted toguided elastic waves since it can occur in zero-gap systems such as photoniccrystals, chiral metamaterials or graphene. Negative reflection can thus becomea tool of choice for the control of waves in all fields of wave physics.",Transition Systems for Model Generators - A Unifying Approach,Satisfiability solvers for propositional logic,0.15384615384615385,0.3004843884984905
"  It is arguably believed that flatter minima can generalize better. However,it has been pointed out that the usual definitions of sharpness, which considereither the maxima or the integral of loss over a $\delta$ ball of parametersaround minima, cannot give consistent measurement for scale invariant neuralnetworks, e.g., networks with batch normalization layer. In this paper, wefirst propose a measure of sharpness, BN-Sharpness, which gives consistentvalue for equivalent networks under BN. It achieves the property of scaleinvariance by connecting the integral diameter with the scale of parameter.Then we present a computation-efficient way to calculate the BN-sharpnessapproximately i.e., one dimensional integral along the ""sharpest"" direction.Furthermore, we use the BN-sharpness to regularize the training and design analgorithm to minimize the new regularized objective.

"  Designing and implementing comprehensive IT-based support environments for KMin organizations is fraught with many problems. Solving them requires intimateknowledge about the information usage in knowledge works and the scopes oftechnology intervention. In this paper, the Task-oriented OrganizationalKnowledge Management or TOKM, a design theory for building integrated ITplatforms for supporting organizational KM, is proposed. TOKM brings togethertwo apparently mutually exclusive practices of building KM systems, thetask-based approach and the generic or universalistic approach. In developingthe design, the information requirements of knowledge workers in light of aninformation usage model of knowledge works is studied. Then the model isextended to study possibilities of more advanced IT support and formulate themin form of a set of meta-requirements. Following the IS design theory paradigm,a set of artifacts are hypothesized to meet the requirements. Finally, a designmethod, as a possible approach of building an IT-based integrated platform, theKnowledge Work Support Platform (KWSP) to realize the artifacts in order tomeet the requirements, is outlined. The KWSP is a powerful platform forbuilding and maintaining a number of task-type specific Knowledge Work SupportSystems (KWSS) on a common sharable platform. Each KWSS, for the task-typesupported by it, can be easily designed to provide extensive and sophisticatedsupport to individual as well as group of knowledge workers in performing theirrespective knowledge work instances","Luminosity Determination in pp Collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV Using the

"  Combining neural networks with continuous logic and multicriteria decisionmaking tools can reduce the black box nature of neural models. In this study,we show that nilpotent logical systems offer an appropriate mathematicalframework for a hybridization of continuous nilpotent logic and neural models,helping to improve the interpretability and safety of machine learning. In ourconcept, perceptrons model soft inequalities; namely membership functions andcontinuous logical operators. We design the network architecture beforetraining, using continuous logical operators and multicriteria decision toolswith given weights working in the hidden layers. Designing the structureappropriately leads to a drastic reduction in the number of parameters to belearned. The theoretical basis offers a straightforward choice of activationfunctions (the cutting function or its differentiable approximation, thesquashing function), and also suggests an explanation to the great success ofthe rectified linear unit (ReLU).

"  Measuring testability early in the development life cycle especially atdesign phase is a criterion of crucial importance to software designers,developers, quality controllers and practitioners. However, most of themechanism available for testability measurement may be used in the later phasesof development life cycle. Early estimation of testability, absolutely atdesign phase helps designers to improve their designs before the coding starts.Practitioners regularly advocate that testability should be planned early indesign phase. Testability measurement early in design phase is greatlyemphasized in this study; hence, considered significant for the delivery ofquality software. As a result, it extensively reduces rework during and afterimplementation, as well as facilitate for design effective test plans, betterproject and resource planning in a practical manner, with a focus on the designphase.

Our approach consists in adding a saliency branchto an existing CNN architecture which is used to modulate the standardbottom-up visual features from the original image input, acting as anattentional mechanism that guides the feature extraction process. The main aimof the proposed approach is to enable the effective training of a fine-grainedrecognition model with limited training samples and to improve the performanceon the task, thereby alleviating the need to annotate large dataset. % The vastmajority of saliency methods are evaluated on their ability to generatesaliency maps, and not on their functionality in a complete vision pipeline.Our proposed pipeline allows to evaluate saliency methods for the high-leveltask of object recognition.

"  We investigate the dynamics of negative surface discharges in air throughnumerical simulations with a 2D fluid model. A geometry consisting of a flatdielectric embedded between parallel-plate electrodes is used. Compared tonegative streamers in bulk gas, negative surface streamers are observed to havea higher electron density, a higher electric field and higher propagationvelocity. On the other hand, their maximum electric field and velocity arelower than for positive surface streamers. In our simulations, negative surfacestreamers are slower for larger relative permittivity. Negative chargeaccumulates on a dielectric surface when a negative streamer propagates alongit, which can lead to a high electric field inside the dielectric. If weinitially put negative surface charge on the dielectric, the growth of negativesurface discharges is delayed or inhibited. Positive surface charge has theopposite effect.","High-Order Implicit Time-Marching Methods Based on Generalized

"  In this paper, we present the multi-wavelength study of a high level of solaractivity during which a single active region produced multiple flares/CMEs.According to the sunspot observations, the current solar cycle 24 manifest tobe less intense in comparison with the previous recent sunspot cycles. In thecourse of the current sunspot cycle 24, several small and large sunspot groupshave produced various moderate and intense flare/CME events. There are a fewactive regions with a large number of flaring activities passed across thevisible disk of the Sun during 2012-2015. In this study, we consider the threeperiods 22-29 Oct 2013, 01-08 Nov 2013, and 25 Oct- 08-Nov 2014, during which228 flares have been observed. Considering only active regions near the centralpart of the disk, 59 CMEs (halo or partial) have been reported among which only39 events are associated with flares. We conclude that an active region with alarger area, more complex morphology and stronger magnetic field has acomparatively higher possibility of producing extremely fast CMEs (speed > 1500km/sec). So that among the 5 X class flares of the reported periods, 3 of them(60%) are associated with a CME. The lift-off time for CME-flare associatedevents has a +15 to+30 minute time interval range after the occurrence time ofassociated flares suggesting that the flares produce the CMEs. Additionally, wecompiled the geomagnetic storms occurring within1-5 days after the CME onset.10% of the 59 CMEs are related to a magnetic storm but all are moderate storms.",Monte Carlo study of gating and selection in potassium channels,Gating and efficiency of ionic species in potassium channels,0.5263157894736842,0.33584386823726153

Instead oftraining a model upon the accurate label of each sample, our setting requiresthe model to query with a predicted label of each sample and learn from theanswer whether the guess is correct. This provides one bit (yes or no) ofinformation, and more importantly, annotating each sample becomes much easierthan finding the accurate label from many candidate classes. There are two keysto training a model upon one-bit supervision: improving the guess accuracy andmaking use of incorrect guesses.

"  Band convergence is an effective strategy to improve the thermoelectricperformance of complex bandstructure thermoelectric materials. Half-Heuslersare good candidates for band convergence studies because they have multiplebands near the valence bad edge that can be converged through various bandengineering approaches providing power factor improvement opportunities.Theoretical calculations to identify the outcome of band convergence employvarious approximations for the carrier scattering relaxation times (the mostcommon being the constant relaxation time approximation) due to the highcomputational complexity involved in extracting them accurately. Here, wecompare the outcome of strain-induced band convergence under two suchscattering scenarios: i) the most commonly used constant relaxation timeapproximation and ii) energy dependent inter- and intra-valley scatteringconsiderations for the half-Heuslers NbCoSn and TiCoSb. We show that theoutcome of band convergence on the power factor depends on the carrierscattering assumptions, as well as the temperature. For both materialsexamined, band convergence improves the power factor. For NbCoSn, however, bandconvergence becomes more beneficial as temperature increases, under bothscattering relaxation time assumptions. In the case of TiCoSb, on the otherhand, constant relaxation time considerations also indicate that the relativepower factor improvement increases with temperature, but under the energydependent scattering time considerations, the relative improvement weakens withtemperature. This indicates that the scattering details need to be accuratelyconsidered in band convergence studies to predict more accurate trends.",Trust Evaluation using an Improved Context Similarity Measurement,Weighting Ontology Trees for Context-aware Trust Evaluation,0.25,0.40495158902656925

"  Dasgupta and Shulman showed that a two-round variant of the EM algorithm canlearn mixture of Gaussian distributions with near optimal precision with highprobability if the Gaussian distributions are well separated and if thedimension is sufficiently high. In this paper, we generalize their theory tolearning mixture of high-dimensional Bernoulli templates. Each template is abinary vector, and a template generates examples by randomly switching itsbinary components independently with a certain probability. In computer visionapplications, a binary vector is a feature map of an image, where each binarycomponent indicates whether a local feature or structure is present or absentwithin a certain cell of the image domain. A Bernoulli template can beconsidered as a statistical model for images of objects (or parts of objects)from the same category.

The aim of the paper is to present new evolutionary models, based on the MESApackage, that include the internal structure constants (k$_2$, k$_3$, andk$_4$), the radius of gyration, and the gravitational potential energy forconfigurations computed from the pre-main-sequence (PMS) up to the first ascentgiant branch or beyond. The calculations are available for the threemetallicities [Fe/H]= 0.00, -0.50, and -1.00, which take the recentinvestigations in less metallic environments into account. This new set ofmodels replaces the old ones, published about 15 years ago, using the codeGRANADA.  Core overshooting was taken into account using the mass-f$_{ov}$relationship, which was derived semi-empirically for models more massive than1.2 M$_{\odot}$. The differential equations governing the apsidal motionconstants, moment of inertia, and the gravitational potential energy wereintegrated simultaneously through a fifth-order Runge-Kutta method with atolerance level of 10$^{-7}$.  The resulting models (from 0.8 up to 35.0 M$_{\odot}$) are presented in 54tables for the three metallicities, containing the usual characteristics of anevolutionary model (age, initial masses, log T$_{\rm eff}$, log g, and log L),the constants of internal structure (k$_2$, k$_3$, and k$_4$), the radius ofgyration $\beta,$ and the factor $\alpha$ that is related with thegravitational potential energy.",Proton radioactivity with a Yukawa effective interaction,Half lives of proton emitters,0.16666666666666666,0
"  A novel method to compute time eigenvalues of neutron transport problems ispresented based on solutions to the time dependent transport equation. Usingthese solutions we use the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to form anapproximate transport operator. This approximate operator has eigenvalues thatcan be directly related to the time eigenvalues of the neutron transportequation. This approach works for systems of any level of criticality and doesnot require the user to have estimates for the eigenvalues. Numerical resultsare presented for homogeneous and heterogeneous media. The numerical resultsindicate that the method finds the eigenvalues that are most important to thesolution evolution over a given time range, and the eigenvalue with the largestreal part is not necessarily important to the system evolution.","Two-phonon $\gamma$-vibrational states in rotating triaxial odd-$A$

"  This paper extends the matrix based approach to the setting of multiplesubdivision schemes studied in [Sauer 2012]. Multiple subdivision schemes, incontrast to stationary and non-stationary schemes, allow for level dependentsubdivision weights and for level dependent choice of the dilation matrices.The latter property of multiple subdivision makes the standard definition ofthe transition matrices, crucial ingredient of the matrix approach in thestationary and non-stationary settings, inapplicable. We show how to avoid thisobstacle and characterize the convergence of multiple subdivision schemes interms of the joint spectral radius of certain square matrices derived fromsubdivision weights.

"  We introduce a graph-theoretic approach to synchronizing clocks in an {\em adhoc} network of $N$~timepieces. Clocks naturally drift away from beingsynchronized because of many physical factors. The manual way of clocksynchronization suffers from an inherrent propagation of the so called ""clockdrift"" due to ""word-of-mouth effect."" The current standard way of automatedclock synchronization is either via radio band transmission of the global clockor via the software-based Network Time Protocol (NTP). Synchronization viaradio band transmission suffers from the wave transmission delay, while theclient-server-based NTP does not scale to increased number of clients as wellas to unforeseen server overload conditions (e.g., flash crowd and time-of-dayeffects). Further, the trivial running time of NTP for synchronizing an$N$-node network, where each node is a clock and the NTP server follows asingle-port communication model, is~$\bigO(N)$. We introduce in this paper a$\bigO(\log N)$ time for synchronizing the clocks in exchange for an increaseof $\bigO(N)$ in space complexity, though through creative ""tweaking,"" we laterreduced the space requirement to~$\bigO(1)$. Our graph-theoretic protocolassumes that the network is $\K_N$, while the subset of clocks are in anembedded circulant graph $\C_{n<N}^q$ with $q$~jumps and clock information iscommunicated through circular shifts within the $\C_{n<N}^q$. All $N$~nodescommunicate via a single-port duplex channel model. Theoretically, thissynchronization protocol allows for $N(\log N)^{-1} - 1$ more synchronizationsthan the client-server-based one. Empirically through statistically replicatedmulti-agent-based microsimulation runs, our protocol allows at most 80\% of theclocks synchronized compared to the current protocol which only allows up to30\% after some steady-state time.",Advances in centerline estimation for autonomous lateral control,Complete Perception Pipeline for Autonomous Vehicles,0.28571428571428575,0.45782273986766686

"  Saturn's rings are rock-poor, containing 90%-95% ice by mass. As a group,Saturn's moons interior to and including Tethys are also about 90% ice. Tethysitself contains <6% rock by mass, in contrast to its similar-mass outerneighbor Dione, which contains >40% rock. Here we simulate the evolution of amassive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ringmaterial spreads beyond the Roche limit. We describe the Roche-interior ringwith an analytic model, and use an N-body code to describe material beyond theRoche limit. We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites,including tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipationfactor for Saturn of $Q~10^4$. We find that ring torques and capture of moonsinto mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extendsoutward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relativelyslow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axisdistribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys.We estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometaryimpactors during a late heavy bombardment. We find that the inner moons receivea mass in rock comparable to their current total rock content, while Dione andRhea receive an order-of-magnitude less rock than their current rock content.This suggests that external ontamination may have been the primary source ofrock in the inner moons, and that Dione and Rhea formed from much morerock-rich source material. Reproducing the distribution of rock among thecurrent inner moons is challenging, and appears to require large impactorsstochasticity and/or the presence of some rock in the initial ring.","Hourglass pore effect and membrane osmotic diode behavior: model and

"  This paper rigorously analyses preconditioners for the time-harmonic Maxwellequations with absorption, where the PDE is discretised using curl-conformingfinite-element methods of fixed, arbitrary order and the preconditioner isconstructed using Additive Schwarz domain decomposition methods. The theorydeveloped here shows that if the absorption is large enough, and if thesubdomain and coarse mesh diameters and overlap are chosen appropriately, thenthe classical two-level overlapping Additive Schwarz preconditioner (with PECboundary conditions on the subdomains) performs optimally -- in the sense thatGMRES converges in a wavenumber-independent number of iterations -- for theproblem with absorption. An important feature of the theory is that it allowsthe coarse space to be built from low-order elements even if the PDE isdiscretised using high-order elements. It also shows that additive methods withminimal overlap can be robust. Numerical experiments are given that illustratethe theory and its dependence on various parameters. These experiments motivatesome extensions of the preconditioners which have better robustness forproblems with less absorption, including the propagative case. At the end ofthe paper we illustrate the performance of these on two substantialapplications; the first (a problem with absorption arising from medicalimaging) shows the empirical robustness of the preconditioner againstheterogeneity, and the second (scattering by a COBRA cavity) shows goodscalability of the preconditioner with up to 3,000 processors.",Dense 3D Face Correspondence,Dense correspondences for 3D faces,0.6666666666666665,0.7952707287670506

"  As differentiated planetesimals cool, their cores can solidify from theoutside-in, as evidenced by paleomagnetic measurements and cooling rateestimates of iron meteorites. The details of outside-in solidification and fateof residual core melt are poorly understood. For a core primarily composed ofFe and Ni alloyed with lighter constituent elements, like sulfur, such inwardcore growth would likely be achieved by growth of solid FeNi dendrites. Growthof FeNi dendrites results in interconnected pockets of residual melt thatbecome progressively enriched in sulfur up to a eutectic composition of 31 wtpercent sulfur as FeNi continues to solidify. Here we show that regions ofresidual sulfur-enriched FeNi melt in the core attain sufficient excesspressures to propagate via dikes into the mantle. Thus, core material willintrude into the overlying rocky mantle or possibly even erupt onto theplantesimals surface. We refer to these processes collectively asferrovolcanism. Our calculation show that ferrovolcanic surface eruptions aremore likely on bodies with mantles less than 50 km thick. We show thatintrusive ferromagmatism can produce pallasites, an enigmatic class ofmeteorites composed of olivine crystals entrained in a matrix of FeNi metal.Ferrovolcanic eruptions may explain the observations that Psyche has a bulkdensity inconsistent with iron metorites yet shows evidence of a metallicsurface composition.",Anonymity and verifiability in multi-attribute reverse auction,"A Simple and Effective E-Auction Scheme for Multi-attribute Reverse

  Component-based software engineering aims to reduce software developmenteffort by reusing established components as building blocks of complex systems.Defining components in general-purpose programming languages restricts theirreuse to platforms supporting these languages and complicates componentcomposition with implementation details. The vision of model-driven engineeringis to reduce the gap between developer intention and implementation details bylifting abstract models to primary development artifacts and systematicallytransforming these into executable systems. For sufficiently complex systemsthe transformation from abstract models to platform-specific implementationsrequires augmentation with platform-specific components. We propose amodel-driven mechanism to transform platform-independent logical component &connector architectures into platform-specific implementations combining modeland code libraries. This mechanism allows to postpone commitment to a specificplatform and thus increases reuse of software architectures and components.,A discrete and $q$ Asymptotic Iteration Method,On the existence of a polynomial solution to a difference or $q$-difference,0.2,0

"  Plant aliveness is proven through laboratory experiments and specialscientific instruments. In this paper, we aim to detect the degree of animationof plants based on the magnification of the small color changes in the plant'sgreen leaves using the Eulerian video magnification. Capturing the video undera controlled environment, e.g., using a tripod and direct current (DC) lightsources, reduces camera movements and minimizes light fluctuations; we aim toreduce the external factors as much as possible. The acquired video is thenstabilized and a proposed algorithm used to reduce the illumination variations.Lastly, the Euler magnification is utilized to magnify the color changes on thelight invariant video. The proposed system does not require any special purposeinstruments as it uses a digital camera with a regular frame rate. The resultsof magnified color changes on both natural and plastic leaves show that thelive green leaves have color changes in contrast to the plastic leaves. Hence,we can argue that the color changes of the leaves are due to biologicaloperations, such as photosynthesis.

As an intermediate step, the algorithm solves the overdeterminedlinear least-squares regression involving the adjoint of A (and so can be usedfor this, too). The basis of the algorithm is an obvious but numericallyunstable scheme; suitable use of a preconditioner yields numerical stability.We generate the preconditioner rapidly via a randomized procedure that succeedswith extremely high probability.

The filter operates through two phases: the time updateand the data correction. The time update predicts the robot position byreformulating the kinematics model to be non-memoryless. The correction stepcorrects the prediction by extrapolating the delayed measurement to the presentand then incorporating it to the being estimate as there is no delay.

"  The basic concept in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is to train a largeNeural Network that maximizes the translation performance on a given parallelcorpus. NMT is then using a simple left-to-right beam-search decoder togenerate new translations that approximately maximize the trained conditionalprobability. The current beam search strategy generates the target sentenceword by word from left-to- right while keeping a fixed amount of activecandidates at each time step. First, this simple search is less adaptive as italso expands candidates whose scores are much worse than the current best.Secondly, it does not expand hypotheses if they are not within the best scoringcandidates, even if their scores are close to the best one. The latter one canbe avoided by increasing the beam size until no performance improvement can beobserved. While you can reach better performance, this has the draw- back of aslower decoding speed. In this paper, we concentrate on speeding up the decoderby applying a more flexible beam search strategy whose candidate size may varyat each time step depending on the candidate scores. We speed up the originaldecoder by up to 43% for the two language pairs German-English andChinese-English without losing any translation quality.",Ergodicity of the zigzag process,The zigzag process,0.7499999999999999,0.39011264866539486

The differencebetween gluons and quarks in inelastic processes is found to be weaker thanexpected from color factors, due to a self-quenching effect associated with acut-off modeling the LPM effect.","Families of non-linear subdivision schemes for scattered data fitting

"  In this paper we develop a conservative sharp-interface method dedicated tosimulating multiple compressible fluids. Numerical treatments for a cut cellshared by more than two materials are proposed. First, we simplify theinterface interaction inside such a cell with a reduced model to avoid explicitinterface reconstruction and complex flux calculation. Second, conservation isstrictly preserved by an efficient conservation correction procedure for thecut cell. To improve the robustness, a multi-material scale separation model isdeveloped to consistently remove non-resolved interface scales. In addition,the multi-resolution method and local time-stepping scheme are incorporatedinto the proposed multi-material method to speed up the high-resolutionsimulations.

"  We study the hypothesis of high metallicity clumps being responsible for theabundance discrepancy found in planetary nebulae between the values obtainedfrom recombination and collisionaly excited lines. We generate grids ofphotoionization models combining cold metal-rich clumps emitting the heavyelement recombination lines, embedded in a normal metallicity regionresponsible for the forbidden lines. The two running parameters of the grid arethe metallicity of the clumps and its volume fraction relative to the wholenebula. We determine the density and temperatures (from the Balmer jump and the[OIII] 5007/4363 A line ratio), and the ionic abundances from the collisionaland recombination lines, as an observer would do. The metallicity of thenear-to-solar region is recovered, while the metallicity of the clumps issystematically underestimated, by up to 2 orders of magnitude. This is mainlybecause most of the H$\beta$ emission is coming from the ""normal"" region, andonly the small contribution emitted by the metal-rich clumps should be used.

"  Very recently, there has been significant progress with establishing a commonphenomenology of the superconducting cuprates in terms of nuclear magneticresonance (NMR) shift and relaxation. Different from the old interpretation, itwas shown that the shifts demand two coupled spin components with differenttemperature dependencies. One spin component couples isotropically to theplanar Cu nucleus and is likely to reside at planar O, while the other,anisotropic component has its origin in the planar copper $3d(x^2-y^2)$orbital. Nuclear relaxation, on the other hand, was found to be ratherubiquitous and Fermi liquid-like for planar Cu, i.e., it is independent ofdoping and material, apart from the sudden drop at the superconductingtransition temperature, $T_{\rm c}$. However, there is a doping and materialdependent anisotropy that is independent on temperature, above and below$T_{\rm c}$. Here we present a slightly different analysis of the shifts thatfits all planar Cu shift data. In addition we are able to derive a simple modelthat explains nuclear relaxation based on these two spin components. Inparticular, the only outlier so far, \lsco, can be understood, as well. Whilethis concerns predominantly planar Cu, it is argued that the two componentmodel should fit all cuprate shift and relaxation data.",Thermal Dynamics of Quarks and Mesons in N=2* Yang-Mills Theory,Quenched fundamental matter in $\mathcal{N}=2^\ast$ Yang,0.380952380952381,0.3280443278078623

Based on first-principles calculations, the spontaneous spinpolarization could be realized by TM doping in ferroelectric SnTe monolayer. Inaddition to in-plane ferroelectric polarization, the out-of-plane ferroelectricpolarization emerges in Mn (Fe)-doped SnTe monolayer due to the internaldisplacement of TM from the surface. Interestingly, the crystalline fieldcentered on TM and interaction between the dopant and Te gradually enhancedwith the increment of atomic number of doping elements, which explains why theformation energy decreases.

"  The Sunspot Number, created by R.Wolf in 1849, provides a direct long-termrecord of solar activity from 1700 to the present. In spite of its central rolein multiple studies of the solar dynamo and of the past Sun-Earth relations, itwas never submitted to a global critical revision. However, variousdiscrepancies with other solar indices recently motivated a full re-calibrationof this series. Based on various diagnostics and corrections established in theframework of several Sunspot Number Workshops and described in Clette et al.2014, we assembled all corrections in order to produce a new standard versionof this reference time series. In this paper, we explain the three maincorrections and the criteria used to choose a final optimal version of eachcorrection factor or function, given the available information and publishedanalyses. We then discuss the good agreement obtained with the Group sunspotNumber derived from a recent reconstruction. Among the implications emergingfrom this re-calibrated series, we also discuss the absence of a rising seculartrend in the newly-determined solar cycle amplitudes, also in relation withcontradictory indications derived from cosmogenic radionuclides.

"  The purposes of this paper are testing an efficiency algorithm based on LBMand using it to analyze two-dimensional natural convection with low Prandtlnumber. Steady state or oscillatory results are obtained using doublemultiple-relaxation-time thermal lattice Boltzmann method. The velocity andtemperature fields are solved using D2Q9 and D2Q5 models, respectively. Withdifferent Rayleigh number, the tested natural convection can either achieve tosteady state or oscillatory. With fixed Rayleigh number, lower Prandtl numberleads to a weaker convection effect, longer oscillation period and higheroscillation amplitude for the cases reaching oscillatory solutions. At fixedPrandtl number, higher Rayleigh number leads to a more notable convectioneffect and longer oscillation period. Double multiple-relaxation-time thermallattice Boltzmann method is applied to simulate the low Prandtl number fluidnatural convection.

"  Objective: To determine whether brain volume is associated with functionaloutcome after acute ischemic stroke (AIS).  Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data of the multi-site, internationalhospital-based MRI-GENetics Interface Exploration (MRI-GENIE) study (July 1,2014- March 16, 2019) with clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)obtained on admission for index stroke and functional outcome assessment.Post-stroke outcome was determined using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score(0-6; 0: asymptomatic; 6 death) recorded between 60-190 days after stroke.Demographics and other clinical variables including acute stroke severity(measured as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), vascular riskfactors, and etiologic stroke subtypes (Causative Classification of Stroke)were recorded during index admission.  Results: Utilizing the data from 912 acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients(65+/-15 years of age, 58% male, 57% history of smoking, and 65% hypertensive)in a generalized linear model, brain volume (per 155.1cm^3 ) was associatedwith age (beta -0.3 (per 14.4 years)), male sex (beta 1.0) and prior stroke(beta -0.2). In the multivariable outcome model, brain volume was anindependent predictor of mRS (beta -0.233), with reduced odds of worselong-term functional outcomes (OR: 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-0.9) in those with largerbrain volumes.  Conclusions: Larger brain volume quantified on clinical MRI of AIS patientsat time of stroke purports a protective mechanism. The role of brain volume asa prognostic, protective biomarker has the potential to forge new areas ofresearch and advance current knowledge of mechanisms of post-stroke recovery.","The harmonic balance method for bifurcation analysis of large-scale

"  A three-dimensional numerical model for an accretion process investigation inthe magnetosphere of a white dwarf in magnetic cataclysmic variables isdeveloped. The model assumes that the white dwarf has a dipole magnetic fieldwith its symmetry axis inclined to the rotation axis. The model is based on theequations of modified MHD, that describe the mean flow parameters in the waveMHD turbulence. Diffusion of the magnetic field and radiative heating andcooling are taken into account. The suitability of the model is confirmed bymodeling the accretion in a typical intermediate polar. The computations showthat a magnetosphere forms around the accretor, with the accretion occurringvia columns. The accretion columns have a curtain-like shape, and arc-shapedzones of energy release form on the surface of the white dwarf in the magneticpoles area as a result of the matter infall.","Waterfall Atrous Spatial Pooling Architecture for Efficient Semantic

"  We describe the successful design, implementation, and operation of a 12 GHzholography system installed on the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT).We have used a geostationary satellite beacon to construct high-resolutionholographic images of the telescope mirror surface irregularities. These imageshave allowed us to infer and apply improved position offsets for the 2209actuators which control the active surface of the primary mirror, therebyachieving a dramatic reduction in the total surface error (from 390 microns to~240 microns, rms). We have also performed manual adjustments of the corneroffsets for a few panels. The expected improvement in the radiometric apertureefficiency has been rigorously modeled and confirmed at 43 GHz and 90 GHz. Theimprovement in the telescope beam pattern has also been measured at 11.7 GHzwith greater than 60 dB of dynamic range. Symmetric features in the beampattern have emerged which are consistent with a repetitive pattern in theaperture due to systematic panel distortions. By computing average images foreach tier of panels from the holography images, we confirm that the magnitudeand direction of the panel distortions, in response to the combination ofgravity and thermal gradients, are in general agreement with finite-elementmodel predictions. The holography system is now fully integrated into the GBTcontrol system, and by enabling the telescope staff to monitor the health ofthe individual actuators, it continues to be an essential tool to supporthigh-frequency observations.","On sensitive dependence on initial conditions and existence of physical

"  A coupled optoelectronic model was implemented along with the differentialevolution algorithm to assess the efficacy of grading the bandgap of the CZTSSelayer for enhancing the power conversion efficiency of thin-film CZTSSe solarcells. Both linearly and sinusoidally graded bandgaps were examined, with themolybdenum backreflector in the solar cell being either planar or periodicallycorrugated. Whereas an optimally graded bandgap can dramatically enhance theefficiency, the effect of periodically corrugating the backreflector is modestat best. An efficiency of 21.74% is predicted with sinusoidal grading of a870-nm-thick CZTSSe layer, in comparison to 12.6% efficiency achievedexperimentally with a 2200-nm-thick homogeneous CZTSSe layer. Highelectron-hole-pair generation rates in the narrow-bandgap regions and a highopen-circuit voltage due to a wider bandgap close to the front and rear facesof the CZTSSe layer are responsible for the high enhancement of efficiency.","Breakdown of self-similarity at the crests of large amplitude standing

"  High performance thermoelectric devices requires materials with low latticethermal conductivities. Many strategies, such as phonon engineering, have beenmade to reduce lattice thermal conductivity without simultaneously decrease ofthe charge transport performance. It is a simple and effective approach to usematerials with heavy element to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Here,based on the first-principles calculations and phonon Boltzmann transportequations, we find the replacement of Zr with heavy element Hf in ZrNCl doesn'treduce the lattice thermal conductivity, instead, it surprisingly increases byabout 4 times at 300K. This unusual lattice thermal conductivity is mainlyattributed to the dramatic enhancement in phonon lifetimes in Hf compound,originating from the strong interatomic bonding due to lanthanide contraction.Our findings unveil the microscopic mechanisms of high thermal transportproperties in materials with heavy element, providing an alternative strategyin materials design with low lattice thermal conductivity for thermoelectricapplications such as power restoration and generation.",Birational Geometry of Singular Moduli Spaces of O'Grady Type,Bridgeland semistable objects on K3 surfaces,0.0,0
"  We present electronic transport measurements through short and narrow (30x30nm) single layer graphene constrictions on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate.While the general observation of Coulomb-blockade is compatible with earlierwork, the details are not: we show that the area on which charge is localizedcan be significantly larger than the area of the constriction, suggesting thatthe localized states responsible for Coulomb-blockade leak out into thegraphene bulk. The high bulk mobility of graphene on hexagonal boron nitride,however, seems not consistent with the short bulk localization length requiredto see Coulomb-blockade. To explain these findings, charge must instead beprimarily localized along the imperfect edges of the devices and extend alongthe edge outside of the constriction. In order to better understand themechanisms, we compare the experimental findings with tight-binding simulationsof such constrictions with disordered edges. Finally we discuss previousexperiments in the light of these new findings.","Optimal exponents for Hardy--Littlewood inequalities for $m$-linear

"  We study a distinct supersymmetric signal of multi-photons in associationwith jets and missing transverse energy. At least one of these photons has theorigin in displaced vertex, thus delayed and non-pointing. We consider asupersymmetric scenario in which the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetricparticle (LSP) (with a mass $\sim 1~{keV}$) and the lightest neutralino is thenext-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP). The NLSP decays dominantlyinto a photon and a gravitino within the detector with a decay length rangingfrom $c\tau_{\tilde{\chi}}\sim$ 50-100 cm. In addition, we assume that thesecond lightest neutralino and the lightest neutralino are nearly degenerateand this leads to a prompt radiative decay of the next-to-lightest neutralinointo a photon and a lightest neutralino with a large branching ratio. Suchdegenerate neutralinos can be realised in various representations of the$SU(5)$, $SO(10)$, and $E(6)$ Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). The non-pointingphotons can be reconstructed at the electromagnetic calorimeter of the ATLASinner-detector, which have been designed with good timing and directionalresolution.

"  It is often desirable to build a statistical emulator of a complex computersimulator in order to perform analysis which would otherwise be computationallyinfeasible. We propose methodology to model multivariate output from a computersimulator taking into account output structure in the responses. The utility ofthis approach is demonstrated by applying it to a chemical and biologicalhazard prediction model. Predicting the hazard area that results from anaccidental or deliberate chemical or biological release is imperative in civiland military planning and also in emergency response. The hazard area resultingfrom such a release is highly structured in space and we therefore propose theuse of a thin-plate spline to capture the spatial structure and fit a Gaussianprocess emulator to the coefficients of the resultant basis functions. Wecompare and contrast four different techniques for emulating multivariateoutput: dimension-reduction using (i) a fully Bayesian approach with aprincipal component basis, (ii) a fully Bayesian approach with a thin-platespline basis, assuming that the basis coefficients are independent, and (iii) a""plug-in"" Bayesian approach with a thin-plate spline basis and a separablecovariance structure; and (iv) a functional data modeling approach using atensor-product (separable) Gaussian process. We develop methodology for the twothin-plate spline emulators and demonstrate that these emulators significantlyoutperform the principal component emulator. Further, the separable thin-platespline emulator, which accounts for the dependence between basis coefficients,provides substantially more realistic quantification of uncertainty, and isalso computationally more tractable, allowing fast emulation. For highresolution output data, it also offers substantial predictive and computationaladvantages over the tensor-product Gaussian process emulator.",QOS based user driven scheduler for grid environment,QoS based User Driven Scheduling for Autonomic Grid,0.875,0.7071067811865476

"  FeMoco, MoFe$_7$S$_9$C, has been shown to be the active catalytic site forthe reduction of nitrogen to ammonia in the nitrogenase protein. Anunderstanding of its electronic structure including strong electron correlationis key to designing mimic catalysts capable of ambient nitrogen fixation.Active spaces ranging from [54, 54] to [65, 57] have been predicted for aquantitative description of FeMoco's electronic structure. However, awavefunction approach for a singlet state using a [54,54] active space wouldrequire 10$^{29}$ variables. In this work, we systematically explore theactive-space size necessary to qualitatively capture strong correlation inFeMoco and two related moieties, MoFe$_3$S$_7$ and Fe$_4$S$_7$. Using CASSCFand 2-RDM methods, we consider active-space sizes up to [14,14] and [30,30],respectively, with STO-3G, 3-21G, and DZP basis sets and use fractionalnatural-orbital occupation numbers to assess the level of multireferenceelectron correlation, an examination of which reveals a competition betweensingle-reference and multi-reference solutions to the electronicSchr\""{o}dinger equation for smaller active spaces and a consistentmulti-reference solution for larger active spaces.","Density Matrix Renormalization Group Study of Nematicity in Two

Forsuch circuits efficient statistical timing analysis algorithms are needed totake increasing process vari- ations into account. But existing methods solvingthis problem are still computationally expensive and can only provide the yieldat a given clock period. In this paper we propose a method combining reducediterations and graph transformations. The reduced iterations extract setup timeconstraints and identify a subgraph for the following graph transformationshandling the constraints from nonpositive loops. The combined algorithms arevery efficient, more than 10 times faster than other existing methods, andresult in a parametric minimum clock period, which together with the hold timeconstraints can be used to compute the yield at any given clock period veryeasily.","Probing CP violation in the neutrino sector with magic baseline

For this, I start from Taleb's statement that antifragile systemslove errors, and discuss whether traditional software dependability fits intothis class. The answer is somewhat negative, although adaptive fault toleranceis antifragile: the system learns something when an error happens, and alwaysimrpoves. Automatic runtime bug fixing is changing the code in response toerrors, fault injection in production means injecting errors in businesscritical software. I claim that both correspond to antifragility.

"  We show that for hadronic transverse energy $E_T$ in hadron-hadroncollisions, the classic Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) argument for thecancellation of Glauber gluons breaks down at the level of two Glauber gluonsexchanged between the spectators. Through an argument that relates the diagramswith these Glauber gluons to events containing additional soft scatterings, wesuggest that this failure of the CSS cancellation actually corresponds to afailure of the `standard' factorisation formula with hard, soft and collinearfunctions to describe $E_T$ at leading power. This is because the observablereceives a leading power contribution from multiple parton interaction (orspectator-spectator Glauber) processes. We also suggest that the same argumentcan be used to show that a whole class of observables, which we refer to as MPIsensitive observables, do not obey the standard factorisation at leading power.MPI sensitive observables are observables whose distributions in hadron-hadroncollisions are disrupted strongly by the presence of multiple partoninteractions (MPI) in the event.

"  We present a simulation-based study using deep convolutional neural networks(DCNNs) to identify neutrino interaction vertices in the MINERvA passivetargets region, and illustrate the application of domain adversarial neuralnetworks (DANNs) in this context. DANNs are designed to be trained in onedomain (simulated data) but tested in a second domain (physics data) andutilize unlabeled data from the second domain so that during training onlyfeatures which are unable to discriminate between the domains are promoted.MINERvA is a neutrino-nucleus scattering experiment using the NuMI beamline atFermilab. $A$-dependent cross sections are an important part of the physicsprogram, and these measurements require vertex finding in complicated events.To illustrate the impact of the DANN we used a modified set of simulation inplace of physics data during the training of the DANN and then used the labelof the modified simulation during the evaluation of the DANN. We find that deeplearning based methods offer significant advantages over our prior track-basedreconstruction for the task of vertex finding, and that DANNs are able toimprove the performance of deep networks by leveraging available unlabeled dataand by mitigating network performance degradation rooted in biases in thephysics models used for training.","CoSpace: Common Subspace Learning from Hyperspectral-Multispectral

"  We study the clustering of the highest-z galaxies (from ~ $0.1$ to a few tensMpc scales) using the BLUETIDES simulation and compare it to currentobservational constraints from Hubble legacy and Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) fields(at $z=6-7.2$). With a box length of $400$ $Mpc/h$ on each side and $0.7$trillion particles, BLUETIDES is the largest high resolution cosmologicalhydrodynamic simulation to date ideally suited for studies of high-z galaxies.We find that galaxies with magnitude $m_{UV}<27.7$ have a bias ($b_g$) of$8.1\pm 1.2$ at $z=8$, and typical halo masses $M_H \gtrsim 6\times10^{10}M_{\odot}$. Given the redshift evolution between $z=8$ to $z=10$($b_g\propto(1+z)^{1.6}$), our inferred values of the bias and halo masses areconsistent with measured angular clustering at $z \sim 6.8$ from these brightersamples. The bias of fainter galaxies (in the Hubble legacy field at $H_{160}\lesssim29.5$) is $5.9\pm0.9$ at $z=8$ corresponding to halo masses $M_H\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We investigate directly the 1-halo term intheclustering and show that it dominates on scales $r \lesssim 0.1$ Mpc/$h$($\Theta \lesssim 3""$) with non-linear effect at transition scales between the1-halo and 2-halo term affecting scales 0.1 $\lesssim r \lesssim $ 20 Mpc/$h$($3""\lesssim \Theta \lesssim 90""$). Current clustering measurements probe downto the scales in the transition between 1-halo to 2-halo regime wherenon-linear effects are important. The amplitude of the 1-halo term implies thatoccupation numbers for satellites in \texttt{BLUETIDES} are somewhat higherthan standard HODs adopted in these analyses (which predict amplitudes in the1-halo regime suppressed by a factor 2-3). That possibly implies a highernumber of galaxies detected by JWST (at small scales and even faintermagnitudes) observing these fields.","Dynamic Traitor Tracing Schemes, Revisited",Tailor Tracing with Combined Tardos and Oosterwijk,0.16666666666666666,0.6147881529512643

"  Many membrane channels and receptors exhibit adaptive, or desensitized,response to a strong sustained input stimulus, often supported by proteinactivity-dependent inactivation. Adaptive response is thought to be related tovarious cellular functions such as homeostasis and enlargement of dynamic rangeby background compensation. Here we study the quantitative relation betweenadaptive response and background compensation within a modeling framework. Weshow that any particular type of adaptive response is neither sufficient nornecessary for adaptive enlargement of dynamic range. In particular a preciseadaptive response, where system activity is maintained at a constant level atsteady state, does not ensure a large dynamic range neither in input signal norin system output. A general mechanism for input dynamic range enlargement cancome about from the activity-dependent modulation of protein responsiveness bymultiple biochemical modification, regardless of the type of adaptive responseit induces.

"  Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) is among the mostimportant analytical tools in physics, chemistry, and biology. The emergence ofnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, serving as an atomic-sizedmagnetometer, has promoted this technique to single-spin level, even underambient conditions. Despite the enormous progress in spatial resolution, thecurrent megahertz spectral resolution is still insufficient to resolve keyheterogeneous molecular information. A major challenge is the short coherencetimes of the sample electron spins. Here, we address this challenge byemploying a magnetic noise-insensitive transition between states of differentsymmetry. We demonstrate a 27-fold narrower spectrum of single substitutionalnitrogen (P1) centers in diamond with linewidth of several kilohertz, and thensome weak couplings can be resolved. Those results show both spatial andspectral advances of NV center-based EPR, and provide a route towardsanalytical (EPR) spectroscopy at single-molecule level.","Sharp Continuity Results for the Short-Time Fourier Transform and for

"  In this paper we analyse super-Chern-Simons theory in $\mathcal{N} =1$superspace formalism, in the presence of a boundary. We modify the Lagrangianfor the Chern-Simons theory in such a way that it is supersymmetric even in thepresence of a boundary. Also, even though the Chern-Simons theory is not gaugeinvariant in the presence of a boundary, if it is suitable coupled to a gaugedWess-Zumino-Witten model, then the resultant theory can be made gaugeinvariant. Thus, by suitably adding extra boundary degrees of freedom, thegauge and supersymmetry variations of the boundary theory exactly cancel theboundary terms generated by the variations of the bulk Chern-Simons theory. Wealso discuss how this can be applied to the ABJM model in $\mathcal{N} =1$superspace, and we then describe the BRST and anti-BRST symmetries of theresultant gauge invariant supersymmetric theory.","Scaling and Balancing for High-Performance Computation of Optimal

"  We consider the cosmological evolution induced by the free energy F of a gasof maximally supersymmetric heterotic strings at finite temperature and weakcoupling in dimension D>=4. We show that F, which plays the role of aneffective potential, has minima associated to enhanced gauge symmetries, whereall internal moduli can be attracted and dynamically stabilized. Using the factthat the heterotic/type I S-duality remains valid at finite temperature and canbe applied at each instant of a quasi-static evolution, we find in the dualtype I cosmology that all internal NS-NS and RR moduli in the closed stringsector and the Wilson lines in the open string sector can be stabilized. Forthe special case of D=6, the internal volume modulus remains a flat direction,while the dilaton is stabilized. An essential role is played by light D-stringmodes wrapping the internal manifold and whose contribution to the free energycannot be omitted, even when the type I string is at weak coupling. As aresult, the order of magnitude of the internal radii expectation values on thetype I side is (lambda_I alpha')^{1/2}, where lambda_I is the ten-dimensionalstring coupling. The non-perturbative corrections to the type I free energy canalternatively be described as effects of ""thermal E1-instantons"", whoseworldsheets wrap the compact Euclidean time cycle.","Theoretical and simulation studies of characteristics of a Compton light

"  During the last years, Graphene based Field Effect Transistors (GFET) haveshown outstanding RF performance; therefore, they have attracted considerableattention from the electronic devices and circuits communities. At the sametime, analytical models that predict the electrical characteristics of GFETshave evolved rapidly. These models, however, have a complexity level that canonly be handled with the help of a circuit simulator. On the other hand, analogcircuit designers require simple models that enable them to carry out fast handcalculations, i.e., to create circuits using small-signal hybrid-{\pi} models,calculate figures of merit, estimate gains, pole-zero positions, etc. Thispaper presents a comprehensive GFET model that is simple enough for being usedin hand-calculations during circuit design and at the same time it is accurateenough to capture the electrical characteristics of the devices in theoperating regions of interest. Closed analytical expressions are provided forthe drain current ID, small-signal transconductance gain gm, output resistancero, and parasitic Vgs and Cgd. In addition, figures of merit such as intrinsicvoltage gain AV, transconductance efficiency gm/ID, and transit frequency fTare presented. The proposed model has been compared to a complete analyticalmodel and also to measured data available in current literature. The resultsshow that the proposed model follows closely to both the complete analyticalmodel and the measured data; therefore, it can be successfully applied in thedesign of GFET analog circuits.","Beyond saliency: understanding convolutional neural networks from

"  (Abridged) We present the angular power spectra derived from the 7-year mapsand discuss the cosmological conclusions that can be inferred from WMAP dataalone. The third acoustic peak in the TT spectrum is now well measured by WMAP.In the context of a flat LambdaCDM model, this improvement allows us to placetighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP data alone, and on theepoch of matter-radiation equality, The temperature-polarization (TE) spectrumis detected in the 7-year data with a significance of 20 sigma, compared to 13sigma with the 5-year data. The low-l EE spectrum, a measure of the opticaldepth due to reionization, is detected at 5.5 sigma significance when averagedover l = 2-7. The BB spectrum, an important probe of gravitational waves frominflation, remains consistent with zero. The upper limit on tensor modes frompolarization data alone is a factor of 2 lower with the 7-year data than it wasusing the 5-year data (Komatsu et al. 2010). We test the parameter recoveryprocess for bias and find that the scalar spectral index, ns, is biased high,but only by 0.09 sigma, while the remaining parameters are biased by < 0.15sigma. The improvement in the third peak measurement leads to tighter lowerlimits from WMAP on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g.,neutrinos) in the early universe: Neff > 2.7 (95% CL).

We train the policy entirely in simulation byleveraging demonstrations from an optimal controller that has access toprivileged information. We use appropriate abstractions of the visual input toenable transfer to a real quadrotor. We show that the resulting policy can bedirectly deployed in the physical world without any fine-tuning on real data.Our methodology has several favorable properties: it does not require a humanexpert to provide demonstrations, it cannot harm the physical system duringtraining, and it can be used to learn maneuvers that are challenging even forthe best human pilots.

Here, a specificcontact pattern scheme with interdigitated Schottky andgraphene/insulator/silicon (GIS) structures is explored to experimentallydemonstrate highly sensitive G/Si photodiodes. With the proposed design, anexternal quantum efficiency (EQE) of > 80 % is achieved for wavelengths rangingfrom 380 to 930 nm. A maximum EQE of 98% is observed at 850 nm, where theresponsivity peaks to 635 mA/W, surpassing conventional Si p-n photodiodes.This efficiency is attributed to the highly effective collection of chargecarriers photogenerated in Si under the GIS parts of the diodes. Theexperimental data is supported by numerical simulations of the diodes. Based onthese results, a definition for the true active area in G/Si photodiodes isproposed, which may serve towards standardization of G/Si based optoelectronicdevices.","The energy of waves in the photosphere and lower chromosphere: IV.
